//! `infra/ops/ops-runner.sh` is RUN, not read — against a stubbed
//! system of record (a `curl` on PATH that serves one open packet on
//! GET and records the completion on PUT), so every verdict below is
//! one the runner actually made.
//!
//! THE DEFECT (backlog 6964f9e8, measured 2026-09-08). The forge runner
//! refused ops-request 6d0c4e37 — `publish-github-pr --check`, the
//! verb's own no-network input check — with `verb publish-github-pr
//! takes at most 0 arg(s), got 1`. Two gaps: the allowlist had no way
//! to admit a bounded literal, so the only way to exercise the verb
//! was the real run; and the reason lived only in the forge journal —
//! the packet's step said `refused` and nothing else (CLAUDE.md
//! §Diagnosis: a verdict must name what failed).
//!
//! So: a param may be a `one_of` literal list (equality, never a
//! packet-supplied word in the argv), `optional` drops the placeholder
//! when the arg is absent, and every refusal writes `reason` on the
//! step — the same text the runner logs.
//!
//! The runner is sh + jq. A box without jq skips these with a line
//! saying so; the gate image has it.
